Secret Glenta
=============

Like secret santa, but by Glen.

Our group contains a bunch of couples, so there is a way to make sure couples
don't get each other.

How To
------

Copy settings.py.sample, then modify the following settings:

Define an array of people: name, email, [people_to_avoid]

    PEOPLE = [
        ['Glen 1', 'glen1@example.com', 'Glen 2', 'Glen 3'],
        ['Glen 2', 'glen2@example.com', 'Glen 1'],
        ['Glen 3', 'glen3@example.com', ],
        ['Glen 4', 'glen4@example.com', ],
    ]

Fill out SMTP Settings

    SMTP = {
        'host': 'smtp.gmail.com',
        'port': 587,
        'mode': 'ssl',
        'login': 'my.gmail.address@gmail.com',
        'password': 'my.gmail.password',
        'from': ('Sender Name', 'me@foo.com')
    }

Customise message if needed

    MESSAGE = """Dear %s,

    In the forthcoming Secret Santa, you will be buying for %s.

    The maximum spending limit is £5.

    Please keep it secret!

    This message was automatically generated by a computer program - nobody knows who is buying for who.
    """
